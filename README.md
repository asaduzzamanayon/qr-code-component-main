## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt how to solve a simple project on my own without stumbling upon tutorial hell. I learnt about css custom properties. How to integrate github to my own project and also how to structure a html, css project altogether.

### Useful resources

- (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) - This helped me to learn about custom css properties and how to implement it to this project.
